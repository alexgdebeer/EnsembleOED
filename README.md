# Ensemble Kalman Inversion for Optimal Experimental Design

This repository contains code to demonstrate the use of ensemble Kalman inversion as part of Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) for inverse problems arising in geophysics.

## TODO:
 - Get a Darcy flow test case working.
 - Write a (parallelised) implementation of EKI-DMC.
