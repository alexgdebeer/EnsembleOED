# Ensemble Kalman Inversion for Optimal Experimental Design

This repository contains code to demonstrate the use of ensemble Kalman inversion as part of Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) for inverse problems arising in geophysics.

## TODO:
### OED
 - Try some measures of non-Gaussianity, including KL-divergence based on density of maximum likelihood Gaussian.
 - Consider thinking about methods to remove the particles that get "disconnected" from the rest of the ensemble?
