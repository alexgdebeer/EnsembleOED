# Ensemble-Based Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design

This repository contains code to demonstrate the use of ensemble methods for Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) problems arising in geophysics.

## Getting Started

First, install Julia >= 1.9.0. 
Clone the repository, then create an environment with the project dependencies by running the following in the Julia REPL:
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```
The top level of the repository contains two scripts which can be run:
 - `run_oed_high_dim.jl` runs 
 - `run_oed_low_dim.jl`
