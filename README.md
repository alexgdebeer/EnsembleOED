# Ensemble Kalman Inversion for Optimal Experimental Design

This repository contains code to demonstrate the use of ensemble Kalman inversion as part of Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) for inverse problems arising in geophysics.

## TODO:
### OED
 - Trial against other (random?) designs. Should I use the same observations as before or generate new ones?
